# Sales_Data_2019
In this project we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

We start by cleaning our data. 
Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 4 high level business questions related to our data:

# Question 1: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
# Question 2:What city sold the most product?
# Question 3:What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
# Question 4:What product sold the most?
